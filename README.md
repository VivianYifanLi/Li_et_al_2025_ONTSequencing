This repostory contains scripts and data files generated for the study titled "Evaluation of full-length 16s rRNA amplicon sequencing using Oxford Nanopore Technologies for diversity surveys of understudied microbiomes".



Figure 1

- Input files and scripts used to generate Figure 1 in Results section 3.1: Short-read sequencing generates more data but long-read sequencing achieves finer taxonomic resolution and detects more taxa.

Figure 2

- Input files and scripts used to generate Figure 2 in Results section 3.3: Genus-level taxonomic profiling of a mock bacterial community

Figure 3

- Input files and scripts used to generate Figure 3 in Results section 3.5: No batch effects detected across full-length 16S sequencing runs

Figure 4

- Input files and scripts used to generate Figure 4 in Results section 3.6: Taxonomic diversity in Symbiodiniaceae culture microbiomes are sufficiently captured by 10,000 to 30,000 reads

Figure 5

- Input files and scripts used to generate Figure 5 in Results section 3.7: Symbiodiniaceae microbiomes demonstrate both inter- and intraspecific variation
